🐞 QuickBugs — Brand & Copy Identity System

For Windsurf AI Implementation

⸻

1. Brand Core

Product Name

QuickBugs

Category

Lightweight bug reporting infrastructure for Jira and Linear teams.

One-Line Positioning

Forward bugs to Jira or Linear. See patterns. Ship faster.

Expanded Positioning

QuickBugs captures bugs with screenshots or video, forwards them directly to Jira or Linear, and logs lightweight metadata for release analytics — without storing media or adding infrastructure complexity.

⸻

2. Target Audience Model

Discovery and implementation are different.

Primary Discoverer (PM / Product Lead)
	•	Wants clarity
	•	Wants visibility into regressions
	•	Does not want another tool to manage
	•	Cares about shipping velocity

Messaging focus:
	•	Outcomes
	•	Release confidence
	•	Visibility
	•	Faster feedback loops

⸻

Primary Implementer (Developer)
	•	Cares about architecture
	•	Cares about security
	•	Cares about complexity
	•	Hates bloated SaaS
	•	Will inspect SDK and infra

Messaging focus:
	•	No storage
	•	Simple architecture
	•	Supabase + Cloudflare
	•	Encrypted credentials
	•	Minimal overhead

All copy must satisfy both audiences simultaneously.

⸻

3. Tone & Voice Rules

Windsurf must strictly follow these rules.

Tone
	•	Calm
	•	Precise
	•	Confident
	•	Minimal
	•	Infrastructure-grade

Avoid
	•	Exclamation marks
	•	“Revolutionary”
	•	“Game-changing”
	•	“AI-powered”
	•	Vague marketing language
	•	Buzzwords like “empower,” “leverage,” “synergy”

Writing Style
	•	Short sentences.
	•	Direct phrasing.
	•	Specific claims.
	•	No exaggeration.
	•	No fluff.

Example transformation:

❌ “Empowering teams to optimize workflows.”
✅ “Forward bugs. See patterns. Ship faster.”

⸻

4. Core Differentiator Messaging

This must be emphasized consistently:

QuickBugs does NOT store media.

Screenshots and videos are forwarded directly to Jira or Linear.

QuickBugs stores only metadata to power analytics.

Every landing page and product description must reinforce this.

⸻

5. Messaging Pillars

All copy should align with one of these pillars.

1. No Duplicate Storage

Screenshots and videos live in your tracker.
We don’t keep copies.

⸻

2. Lightweight Analytics

See which release introduced regressions.
See which browsers generate the most reports.
See which pages break most often.

⸻

3. Simple Architecture

Built on Supabase + Cloudflare.
Two services. Minimal overhead.

⸻

4. Predictable Scaling

$0 to launch.
Upgrade only when usage justifies it.

⸻

6. Landing Page Copy Framework

Windsurf should structure landing content like this:

⸻

HERO

Headline:
Forward bugs to Jira or Linear. See patterns. Ship faster.

Subheadline:
QuickBugs captures issues with screenshots or video, forwards them directly to your tracker, and logs lightweight metadata for release analytics.

CTA:
Start Free
View Docs

⸻

HOW IT WORKS
	1.	User submits a bug
	2.	QuickBugs forwards it to Jira or Linear
	3.	Metadata is logged (browser, OS, version, page)
	4.	Dashboard surfaces patterns

No duplicate storage.
No new issue tracker.

⸻

DIFFERENTIATION SECTION

Title:
No media storage.

Body:

Encrypted credentials.

Must mention:

13. Windsurf Execution Constraint

When generating copy, Windsurf must:
	•	Reduce vague phrases
	•	Increase specificity
	•	Emphasize Jira/Linear focus
	•	Reinforce no-storage differentiator
	•	Maintain calm technical tone

If copy feels marketing-heavy, rewrite to be more precise.
